# Shorts

This folder contains short codes I've written that are used in my other projects which are self contained and likely to be used again elsewhere.

## rand_str_gen.py

This creates a random string of letters, mixing capitlised and uncapitalised. The function takes the size of the string desired as input.

## factorial.py

This gives the factorial of any given positive integer which it takes as the only input.

## factors.py

This generates a list of factors for any given positive integer.

## factor_pairs.py

This generates a list of factors of a given integer similarly to factors.py but instead lists the corresponding factor pairs in the format 'factor1 x factor2'

## word_counter.py

This short simple program counts words in a given string. I use it in command line to quickly see how long any document or paragraph is. 

## randStringGenerator.html and randStringGenerator.js

This is functionally the same as rand_str_gen.py but in javascript. The html page allows the user to input the desired length of string and then it returns a randomly generated string below the input. It also allows the user to tick a box to include spaces in the outputted string to effectively give a paragraph out put. The chance of a char being a space is 1 in 6.
