# Shorts

This folder contains short codes I've written that are used in my other projects which are self contained and likely to be used again elsewhere.

## rand_str_gen.py

This creates a random string of letters, mixing capitlised and uncapitalised. The function takes the size of the string desired.

## factorial.py

This gives the factorial of any given positive integer which it takes as the only input.
